# üìò Codex Prompt: Generate One Jupyter Notebook Per Lesson for Python for Finance Analysts Curriculum

You are tasked with generating **30 individual Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files**, each corresponding to a lesson in a structured Python curriculum titled **‚ÄúPython for Finance Analysts.‚Äù** The detailed lesson instructions are provided in the markdown file `python_finance_tutorials.md`.

## üìÇ Instruction File

First, read and parse the file `python_finance_tutorials.md` located in the same directory. This file contains all lesson outlines, titles, objectives, and example exercises. You must:

- Identify each lesson from the file.
- Use the title, concepts, and exercises to construct one standalone Jupyter notebook per lesson.
- Preserve the order of the lessons and do not combine them.

## üìä Dataset Requirement

Each notebook must use data from the synthetic dataset generated by the script `content/python4finance/generate_ecommerce_dataset.py`, which creates ecommerce-related CSV files (orders, order items, and products). The dataset should be assumed to exist in the same working directory and loaded using pandas.

## üîß General Requirements (Apply to Every Notebook)

Each notebook must:
1. Be **self-contained**, well-formatted, and **readable like a best-in-class Python coding book**.
2. Begin with a markdown header titled `Lesson XX ‚Äì {Lesson Title}` and include a short introduction (~1 paragraph) on the topic's relevance to financial analysts.
3. Include clear learning objectives.
4. Use high-quality **Markdown** explanations before each block of code.
5. Include **code cells** that demonstrate the concepts using the ecommerce dataset.
6. Include **2 to 4 exercises** that apply the topic to finance questions, with either a solution or guidance.
7. Use appropriate libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `datetime`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, etc.)
8. Focus all examples exclusively on the ecommerce dataset generated from the script.
9. Follow consistent variable naming and clean notebook structure.

## üß† Instruction Format

For each lesson extracted from the file:
- Match the title and content.
- Write explanations that match the **clarity and quality of top Python/finance books**, such as "Python for Data Analysis" or "Automate the Boring Stuff".
- Add at least **2 realistic business use case examples** using the ecommerce dataset.
- Add exercises that reinforce comprehension and analysis.

## üìò Curriculum Source

use the markdown file `python_finance_tutorials.md` as the curriculum but feel free to enhace the topic with additional quality code and explanation that can facilitate the learning process.

## üìÇ Output Format

- Save each notebook using the naming convention:  
  `lesson_##_{title_snake_case}.ipynb`  
  Example: `lesson_01_introduction_to_python.ipynb`
- Ensure each notebook is standalone and ready for learners to open and run.
